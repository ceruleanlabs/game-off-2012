Fork It, We'll Do It Live Game 2012!

You control Phil, this little dude who is trying to navigate through these silly block mazes. He has inherited a magic fork (like seriously, an actual fork) that he can use once he grabs enough blocks of the same color and moves them together. Once he sticks this fork into the blocks, they turn into food that his buddies quickly devour; this a) feeds his buddies who are starving, and b) clears a path for him through the block maze.

There are other silly mechanics such as letting Phil change the color of the blocks, or only move certain colored blocks along special tracks, or combining colors. The possibilities are endless. What this game boils down to, however, is getting from Point A to Point B in order to progress/save the princess/feed his people/whatever. I'm still working on the story. :)
